> We provide a standard M365 data generator as part of this kit, which you can use if your module requires M365 data. If not, you are free to generate your own test data that will suit the new module you are creating. When generating new test data, it is important to make sure that it aligns with existing data or new data you plan to create so it becomes easier to join the tables and create relationships for PowerBI visualization. For example, using the same students and same schools. In this readme file, describe the test data and provide a data dictionary using the table provided below.

# Test data
