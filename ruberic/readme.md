# Quality Rubric
Modules contributed to OEA are categorized in 3 levels: [Basic](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-ms_insights-module/blob/main/ruberic/basic.md), 
[Approved](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-ms_insights-module/blob/main/ruberic/approved.md) and 
[Advanced](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-ms_insights-module/blob/main/ruberic/advanced.md). 

The benchmark for OEA module creation is the [Microsoft Graph Reports API module](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Microsoft_Graph), which meets the requirements for the ‘Advanced’ level. 
This module can be used as a guideline for creating and submitting a new OEA module.

Check the boxes associated with the requirement of each level to keep track of your progress. To check the box, place an x within the square bracket and save/commit.

Example: 
- [x] Place an x within the square bracket [] to mark an item as complete. N.B: To render properly, there shouldn't be any extra space within the square bracket.
